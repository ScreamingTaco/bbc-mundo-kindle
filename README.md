# BBC Mundo to Kindle

I made this for personal use and figured I'd make it public for anyone interested. This program takes the ten most recent stories on BBC Mundo and sends them to a kindle email address.

## Configuration

Change `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the appropriate settings. I recommend setting up a "burner" gmail address to use for sending the files; make sure that "Less Secure Apps" is enabled in your gmail settings and that the gmail address you use is on your [approved sender list](https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle/email) for Amazon documents.
